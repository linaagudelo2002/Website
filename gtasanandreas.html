        <h1>GTA San Andreas</h1>
        <p> It's a 2004 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. 
            It is the fifth main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following Grand Theft Auto: Vice City (2002), and the seventh installment overall. 
            It was released in October 2004 for the PlayStation 2, in June 2005 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox, and in November 2010 for Mac OS X.
             The game is set within an open world environment that players can explore and interact with at their leisure. The story follows former 
             gangster Carl "CJ" Johnson, who returns home following his mother's murder and is drawn back into his former gang and a life of crime while 
             clashing with corrupt authorities and powerful criminals. Carl's journey takes him across the fictional U.S. state of San Andreas, 
             which is heavily based on California and Nevada and encompasses three major cities: Los Santos (inspired by Los Angeles), 
             San Fierro (San Francisco) and Las Venturas (Las Vegas). (wikipedia)
