                    <h2>Grand Theft Auto</h2>
                    <p> It is a series of action-adventure games created by David Jones and Mike Dailly. Later titles were developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. 
                        It is primarily developed by British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its parent company, Rockstar Games. 
                        The name of the series references the term "grand theft auto", used in the United States for motor vehicle theft.
                        Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can complete missions to progress an overall story, as well as engage in various side activities.
                         Most of the gameplay revolves around driving and shooting, with occasional role-playing and stealth elements. The series also has elements of the earlier 
                         beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The games in the Grand Theft Auto series are set in fictional locales modelled after real-life cities, at various 
                         points in time from the early 1960s to the 2010s. The original game's map encompassed three cities—Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco),
                          and Vice City (based on Miami)—but later titles tend to focus on a single setting; usually one of the original three locales, albeit remodelled and significantly expanded. 
                          The series centers on different protagonists who attempt to rise through the ranks of the criminal underworld, although their motives for doing so vary in each title. 
                          The antagonists are commonly characters who have betrayed the protagonist or their organisation, or characters who have the most impact impeding the protagonist's progress. 
                          Several film and music veterans have voiced characters in the games, including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, William Fichtner, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda. (wikipedia)

                    <h2>Compilations</h2>
                    <p>Grand Theft Auto Double Pack was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox, and includes both Grand Theft Auto III and Vice City.
                        Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy is a compilation of III, Vice City, and San Andreas, and was first released in 2005 for the Xbox.
                        It was later re-released for the PlayStation 2, Windows, Mac OS X, and PlayStation 4.The Trilogy also served as the revised package for San Andreas, 
                        which had to be pulled from shelves due to the controversial Hot Coffee mod.[40] A report in August 2021 suggested that Rockstar Dundee was leading 
                        development on a remastered version of the trilogy, using Unreal Engine following some leaks, Rockstar officially announced Grand Theft Auto: 
                        The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition on 8 October 2021. The game will feature graphical and gameplay upgrades, and will replace existing versions on digital retailers. 
                        It will be released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S on 11 November 2021, and for Android and iOS in 2022. (wikipedia)

                    <h2>The Controversy</h2>
                    <p>The game gave teenagers the ability to drive recklessly, murder, and steal. I could see why parents would deem this dangerous. 
                        The game’s story mostly dabbled in fictional mafia wars, violence, and illegal activities. The game saw serious backlash from German, 
                        British and Australian authorities, it was completely banned in Brazil before it could even launch. However, with GTA 3, the creators went 
                        not only 3D but also all out on violence, sex and drugs. In 2005, GTA San Andreas could have been the last of it we’d see. Gamers managed to dig up 
                        hidden codes in the game that unlocked a mini-game that simulated sex. The game had to be revised and released. However, this didn’t slow down Rockstar one bit. (Lifestyleasia)

                    <h1>Best Game Ever</h1>
                    <p>Heavily inspired by Los Angeles, the fictional city of Los Santos is the perfect playground in which players can cause chaos. 
                        Every inch of the city is lovingly crafted with each area typically having its own unique look and feel to it. It's also incredibly large and, 
                        unlike many other open world games with huge maps, it generally keeps barren space to a minimum.
                        It could certainly be argued that the decision to base Los Santos on a real-world city was a bit of a short cut, but it also presents its own 
                        set of unique challenges. While creating a world from scratch requires imagination, recreating an area necessitates a level of detail that few 
                        developers have the time or skill to accomplish. What Rockstar achieved with Los Santos is incredible and worthy of all of the praise and success 
                        the game has garnered over the years. (Gamerant)
